# Mastermind

I built this as a quick project to add to my resume in one afternoon. While most of the program comes from
[Tech With Tim's Tutorial](https://youtu.be/sP-gFDreaQ4?si=oh-pKa8VfT1Guxbt), there are a few added features:
- A main menu that supports both playing the game multiple times and changing settings
- Option to change the amount of tries the player gets
- Option to change the length of the code that the player has to guess

### How to Play
You are given a certain number of tries to guess a code of a certain length. These codes are made up of up to 6 different colors.
For every try, you guess a code of the set length consisting of those 6 valid colors. After guessing, you will be told how many
colors are in the correct spot and how many colors are in the real code, but are in the incorrect spot in your guess. You win
when you guess the code correctly and you lose when you run out of tries.

To play, download the ``game.py`` file and run it, following the instructions given in the game.
